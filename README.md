# node-pointer-compression-builds

Custom builds of Node.js with [V8 pointer compression](https://v8.dev/blog/pointer-compression) enabled. Pointer compression shrinks V8 heap pointers from 8 bytes to 4 bytes, reducing heap memory usage significantly for applications with many heap-allocated objects.

Prebuilt binaries for all platforms are published as GitHub Releases. Each release is triggered manually via the **"Build Node.js from Source"** Actions workflow.

## Build flags

All builds are configured with:

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--experimental-enable-pointer-compression` | Compress V8 heap pointers from 8 → 4 bytes |
| `--experimental-pointer-compression-shared-cage` | Share the compression cage across Isolates in the same process |
| `--without-siphash` | Use a simpler alternative to SipHash for V8 hash seeds |

## Platforms

| Platform | Architecture | Runner |
|---|---|---|
| Linux | x64 | ubuntu-22.04 |
| Linux | arm64 | ubuntu-22.04-arm |
| macOS | x64 | macos-15-intel |
| macOS | arm64 | macos-15 (Apple Silicon) |
| Windows | x64 | windows-2025 |
| Windows | arm64 | windows-11-arm |

## Patches

The builds apply a small set of patches, sourced from the Electron project, on top of the Node.js source tree, stored in [`patches/`](patches/). These are necessary to make the pointer-compression build work:

- **`support_v8_sandboxed_pointers`** — refactors several allocators to allocate within the V8 memory cage, required when `V8_SANDBOXED_POINTERS` is active.
- **`random_build_flag_changes`** — enables the V8 sandbox (`v8_enable_sandbox`) when pointer compression is on, matching V8's expectations.
- **`api_remove_deprecated_getisolate`** — replaces a deprecated `context->GetIsolate()` call with `Isolate::GetCurrent()`, required by newer V8.

### Adding a new patch

```bash
cd node-src
vim some/code/file.cc
git commit
../script/git-export-patches -o ../patches
```

> [!NOTE]
> `git-export-patches` ignores uncommitted files — create a commit first. The commit subject line becomes the patch file name; the body should explain why the patch exists.

Re-exporting patches may cause shasums in unrelated patches to change. This is harmless — include those changes in your PR anyway to keep things consistent for others.

## Building locally

```bash
./build.sh
```

This clones Node.js at the pinned tag, applies all patches, configures with the pointer-compression flags, and installs the result into `./release/`.
